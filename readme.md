##TwitchJS

TwitchJS is a Chrome Extension that I created to interact with users in a given Twitch.TV chat.

I know there are bots out there, but I had yet to see one in JavaScript, so I created this to see if it was possible.

This source can be used as more than just a bot however, for example, I have programmed it to work with an open source JavaScript Tetris game so that Twitch Chat could play Tetris (the stream, has since been taken down). I believe that it can unlock a lot of potential features for HTML5 games in the future.

In order to use, install the extension in Google Chrome, set up your commands, and then visit the channel you want to run the bot on, and you should see a "Start Bot" button next to the chat box. Once you click that, a new tab should open up and start the bot.

#Known Bugs/Downsides
1) The tab the bot is running on HAS to be open/in focus in order for bot to continue chatting.
